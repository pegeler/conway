Conway's Game of Life

Rules
------------------------------------------------------
1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. 
   Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
